CAPACITY
PLANNING

CAPACITY – is the throughput, or the
number of units a facility can hold, receive,
store or produce in a given time.
DESIGN CAPACITY – is the maximum
theoretical output of a system in a given
period under ideal conditions.
EFFECTIVE CAPACITY – is the capacity a
firm expects to achieve given the current
operating constraints.

Two measures of system performance
that are particularly useful:
• UTILIZATION – the percent of design
capacity actually achieved.
UTILIZATION = ACTUAL OUTPUT / DESIGN CAPACITY

• EFFICIENCY – percent
of
effective capacity actually
achieved.
EFFICIENCY = ACTUAL OUTPUT / EFFECTIVE CAPACITY

SAMPLE PROBLEM
1
Sarah James Bakery has a plant for processing Deluxe
breakfast rolls and wants to better understand its
capability. Determine the design capacity, utilization, and
efficiency for this plant when producing this Deluxe roll.
APPROACH: Last week the facility produced 148,000
rolls. The effective capacity is 175,000 rolls. The
production line operates 7 days per week, with three 8hour shifts per day. The line was designed to process the
nut-filled, cinnamon-flavored Deluxe roll at a rate of 1,200
per hour. The firm first computes the design capacity and
then uses the equation to determine the utilization and
efficiency.

SAMPLE PROBLEM 1
SOLUTION:

DESIGN CAPACITY = (7 days x 3 shifts x 8 hours) x
(1,200 rolls per hour)
= 201,600 rolls
UTILIZATION = Actual Output / Design Capacity
= 148,000 / 201,600
= 73.4%
EFFICIENCY = Actual Output / Effective Capacity
= 148,000 / 175,000
= 84.6%

EXPECTED OUTPUT – sometimes referred
to as rated capacity. With a knowledge of
effective capacity and efficiency, a manager
can find the expected output of a facility.
EXPECTED OUTPUT = (EFFECTIVE CAPACITY)(EFFICIENCY)

SAMPLE PROBLEM 2
The manager of Sarah James Bakery now needs to
increase production of the increasingly popular Deluxe roll.
To meet this demand, she will be adding a second
production line.
APPROACH: The manager must determine the expected
output of this second line for the sales department.
Effective capacity on the second line is the same as on the
first line, which is 175,000 Deluxe rolls. The first line is
operating at an efficiency of 84.6% as computed in the
previous sample problem. But, output on the second line
will be no more than 75%. What is the expected output?

SAMPLE PROBLEM 2

SOLUTION:
EXPECTED OUTPUT = (Effective Capacity)(Efficiency)
= (175,000)(75%)

= 131,250 rolls

CAPACITY
CONSIDERATIONS

• Forecast demand accurately
• Understand the technology and
capacity increments
• Find the optimum operating
size or volume
• Build for change

MANAGING DEMAND
• Demand exceeds capacity
• Capacity exceeds demand
• Adjusting to seasonal demands

TACTICS FOR MATCHING
CAPACITY TO DEMAND
1. Making staffing changes
2. Adjusting equipment
3. Improving
processes
to
increase
throughput
4. Redesigning products to facilitate more
throughput
5. Adding process flexibility to better meet
changing product preferences
6. Closing facilities

DEMAND MANAGEMENT – can often be
handled with appointments, reservations, or
a first-come, first-served rule.
CAPACITY
MANAGEMENT
–
when
managing demand is not feasible, then
managing capacity through changes in fulltime, temporary, or part-time staff may be an
option. This is the approach in many
services.

BOTTLENECK
ANALYSIS

CAPACITY
ANALYSIS
–
involves
determining the throughput capacity of
workstations in a system and ultimately the
capacity of the entire system.
BOTTLENECK – is an operation that is the
limiting factor or constraint. It refers to the
literal neck of a bottle that constrains flow or,
in the case of a production system,
constrains throughput.

PROCESS TIME OF A STATION – time to
produce a given number of units at the
workstation
PROCESS TIME OF A SYSTEM – time of the
longest process in the system, which is
defined as the process time of the bottleneck.
PROCESS CYCLE TIME – time it takes for a
unit product to go through the entire empty
system from start to finish.

Triangle = Inventory
Arrows = Precedence Relationships

PROCESS TIME OF A STATION = 2,2,4,24,5,8,6
PROCESS TIME OF A SYSTEM = 24 minutes
PROCESS CYCLE TIME
•X-ray exam: 2+2+4+5+8+6 = 27 minutes
•Cleaning: 2+2+4+24+8+6 = 46 minutes

THEORY OF
CONSTRAINTS

THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS (TOC) – is a
body of knowledge that deals with anything
that limits or constrains an organization’s
ability to achieve its goals. Constraints can be:
•Physical (Process or Personnel Availability,
Raw Materials, Supplies)
•Non-Physical (Procedures, Morale, Training)

TOC FIVE-STEP PROCESS
1. Identify the constraints.
2. Develop
a
plan for overcoming
the identified constraints.
3. Focus resources on accomplishing Step 2.
4. Reduce
the effects
of the
constraints by
offloading work or by
expanding capability.
5. When one set of constraints is overcome,
go back to Step 1 and identify new
constraints.
