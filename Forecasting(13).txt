Learning Objectives
When you complete this chapter you
should be able to:
▸Syntensize the three time horizons and
which models apply for each use
▸Explain when to use each of the four
qualitative models
▸Apply the naive, moving average,
exponential smoothing, and trend methods

Learning Objectives
When you complete this chapter
you should be able to:
▸Compute three measures of forecast
accuracy

What is Forecasting?
▸Process of predicting a future
event
▸Underlying basis
of all business decisions
▹Production
▹Inventory
▹Personnel
▹Facilities

??

Forecasting Time Horizons
 Short-range forecast
 Up to 1 year, generally less than 3 months
 Purchasing, job scheduling, workforce levels, job assignments,
production levels

 Medium-range forecast
 3 months to 3 years
 Sales and production planning, budgeting

 Long-range forecast
 3+ years
 New product planning, facility location, research and
development

Distinguishing Differences
 Medium/long range forecasts deal with more
comprehensive issues and support management
decisions regarding planning and products, plants
and processes
 Short-term forecasting usually employs different
methodologies than longer-term forecasting
 Short-term forecasts tend to be more accurate than
longer-term forecasts

Influence of Product Life Cycle
Introduction – Growth – Maturity – Decline

 Introduction and growth require longer
forecasts than maturity and decline
 As product passes through life cycle,
forecasts are useful in projecting
 Staffing levels
 Inventory levels
 Factory capacity

Product Life Cycle

Types of Forecasts
 Economic forecasts
 Address business cycle – inflation rate,
money supply, housing starts, etc.

 Technological forecasts
 Predict rate of technological progress
 Impacts development of new products

 Demand forecasts
 Predict sales of existing products and services

Strategic Importance of Forecasting
 Human Resources – Hiring, training, laying off
workers
 Capacity – Capacity shortages can result in
undependable delivery, loss of customers, loss
of market share
 Supply Chain Management – Good supplier
relations and price advantages

Seven Steps in Forecasting
1. Determine the use of the forecast
2. Select the items to be forecasted
3. Determine the time horizon of the
forecast
4. Select the forecasting model(s)
5. Gather the data
6. Make the forecast
7. Validate and implement results

The Realities!
 Forecasts are seldom perfect

 Most techniques assume an
underlying stability in the system
 Product family and aggregated
forecasts are more accurate than
individual product forecasts

Forecasting Approaches
Qualitative Methods

 Used when situation is vague and little
data exist
 New products
 New technology

 Involves intuition, experience
 e.g., forecasting sales on Internet

Forecasting Approaches
Quantitative Methods

 Used when situation is ‘stable’ and
historical data exist
 Existing products
 Current technology

 Involves mathematical techniques
 e.g., forecasting sales of SMART TV

Overview of Qualitative Methods
1. Jury of executive opinion
 Pool opinions of high-level experts,
sometimes augment by statistical
models

2. Delphi method
 Panel of experts, queried iteratively

Overview of Qualitative Methods
3. Sales force composite
 Estimates from individual
salespersons are reviewed for
reasonableness, then aggregated

4. Consumer Market Survey
 Ask the customer

Jury of Executive Opinion
 Involves small group of high-level experts and
managers
 Group estimates demand by working together
 Combines managerial experience with statistical
models
 Relatively quick

 ‘Group-think’
disadvantage

Sales Force Composite
 Each salesperson projects his or her
sales
 Combined at district and national
levels
 Sales reps know customers’ wants
 Tends to be overly optimistic

Delphi Method
 Iterative group process, continues until
consensus is reached
 3 types of participants
 Decision makers
 Staff
Staff
 Respondents (Administering
survey)

Decision
Makers
(Evaluate
responses and
make decisions)

Respondents

(People who can make
valuable judgments)

Consumer Market Survey
 Ask customers about purchasing
plans
 What consumers say, and what they
actually do are often different
 Sometimes difficult to answer

Quantitative Approaches: Time- Series
Models

1. Naive approach
2. Moving averages
3. Exponential smoothing

Time Series Forecasting
 Set of evenly spaced numerical data
 Obtained by observing response variable at
regular time periods

 Forecast based only on past values, no
other variables important
 Assumes that factors influencing past and
present will continue influence in future

Time Series Components
Trend

Cyclical

Seasonal

Random

Trend Component
 Persistent, overall upward or
downward pattern
 Changes due to population, technology,
age, culture, etc.
 Typically several years duration

Seasonal Component

 Regular pattern of up and
down fluctuations
 Due to weather, customs,
etc.
 Occurs within a single
year

Naive Approach
 Assumes demand in next
period is the same as
demand in most recent period
 e.g., If January sales were 68, then
February sales will be 68

 Sometimes cost effective and efficient
 Can be good starting point

Moving Average Method
 MA is a series of arithmetic means
 Used if little or no trend
 Used often for smoothing
 Provides overall impression of data over time

Exponential Smoothing
 Form of weighted moving average
 Weights decline exponentially
 Most recent data weighted most

 Requires smoothing constant (α)
 Ranges from 0 to 1
 Subjectively chosen

 Involves little record keeping of past
data

Exponential Smoothing
New forecast = Last period’s forecast
+ a (Last period’s actual demand
– Last period’s forecast)
Ft = Ft – 1 + a(At – 1 - Ft – 1)
where

Ft =
Ft – 1 =
a =

new forecast
previous forecast
smoothing (or weighting)
constant (0 ≤ a ≤ 1)

Exponential Smoothing Example
In January, a car dealer predicted February
demand for 142 Ford Mustangs. Actual February
demand was 153 autos. Using a smoothing
constant chosen by management of a = .20, the
dealer wants to forecast March demand using the
exponential smoothing model.

Exponential Smoothing Example

Predicted demand = 142 Ford Mustangs
Actual demand = 153
Smoothing constant a = .20

Exponential Smoothing Example

Predicted demand = 142 Ford Mustangs
Actual demand = 153
Smoothing constant a = .20

New forecast

= 142 + .2(153 – 142)

Exponential Smoothing Example
Predicted demand = 142 Ford Mustangs
Actual demand = 153
Smoothing constant a = .20

New forecast = 142 + .2(153 – 142)
= 142 + 2.2
= 144.2 ≈ 144 cars

Choosing a Model
The objective is to obtain the most accurate
forecast no matter the technique
We generally do this by selecting the model that
gives us the lowest forecast error

Forecast error = Actual demand - Forecast value
= At - Ft
