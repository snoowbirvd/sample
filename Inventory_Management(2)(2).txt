INTRODUCTION
The amount of material, a company has in stock at a specific time is known as inventory or in
terms of money it can be defined as the total capital investment over all the materials stocked in
the company at any specific time.
Inventory may be in the form of,
 raw material inventory
 in process inventory
 finished goods inventory
 spare parts inventory
 office stationary etc.
As a lot of money is engaged in the inventories along with their high carrying costs, companies
cannot afford to have any money tied in excess inventories. Any excessive investment in
inventories may prove to be a serious drag on the successful working of an organization. Thus
there is a need to manage our inventories more effectively to free the excessive amount of
capital engaged in the materials.
WHAT IS AN INVENTORY?
Inventory refers to stock of goods, commodities, or other economic resources that are
stored or reserved at any given period for future production or for meeting future demand.

Inventory planning is the determination of the type and quantity of inventory items that
would be required at future points for maintaining production schedules. Inventory planning is
generally based on information from the past and also on factors that would arise in future.
Inventory management is the function of directing the movement of goods through the
entire manufacturing cycle from the requisition of raw materials to the inventory/stock of finished
goods in such a manner as to meet the objectives of maximum customer service with minimum
investment and efficiency.
Inventory control is primarily concerned with the inventory cost control. The objectives of
inventory control are:
a. To minimize financial investments in inventories.
b. To ensure availability of the supply of stock at all time.
c. To allow flexibility in production scheduling.
d. To ensure that the value of the material consumed is minimum.
e. Reduce surplus stock.
PURPOSE/FUNCTION OF INVENTORY (ADVANTAGES)

5.
6.

Meet anticipated demand
Decouple production & distribution (Permits constant production quantities)
Take advantage of quantity discounts
Provide hedge against inflation
Protect against shortages
Permit smooth operations through Work in Progress (WIP ) - (WIP means that making
the product has started but not finished due to some reasons, beyond the control of the
organization) (i.e., decouple operations)

DISADVANTAGES OF INVENTORY
1. Higher Cost (item, order and holding costs)
2. Difficult to control
3. Hides production problems
TYPES OF INVENTORIES
There are two types of inventories:
1. Direct inventories – these include items which play a direct role in the manufacturing
process and become an integral part of the finished goods, e.g. raw materials, work in
progress inventories, finished goods inventories, spare parts.
2. Indirect inventories – include those items necessary for manufacturing but do not
become an integral component of the finished product e.g.
a. Lubricants
b. Machinery/equipment
c. Labor

INVENTORY DECISIONS
Inventory decisions include:



How much of an item to order?
When to replenish the inventory of the item?

INVENTORY COSTS
In order to control inventories appropriately, one has to consider all cost elements that are
associated with the inventories. There are four such cost elements, which do affect cost of
inventory.


Unit cost: it is usually the purchase price of the item under consideration. If unit cost is
related with the purchase quantity, it is called as discount price. Also known as item cost.



Procurement (set-up) costs: This includes the cost of order preparation, tender
placement, cost of postages, telephone costs, receiving costs, set up cost etc. Also
known as purchasing, set-up, acquisition or ordering cost.



Carrying (holding) costs: This represents the cost of maintaining inventories in the
plant. It includes the cost of insurance, security, warehouse rent, taxes, interest on
capital engaged, spoilage, breakage etc. It is also stated as the percentage of the unit
value. Also referred as inventory holding cost.



Stockout costs: This represents the cost of loss of demand due to shortage in supplies.
This includes cost of loss of profit, loss of customer, loss of goodwill, penalty etc. Also
referred as shortage cost.

If one year planning horizon is used, the total annual cost of inventory can be expressed as:
Total Annual Cost = Cost of items + Annual Procurement Cost + Annual Carrying
Cost + Stockout Cost
INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
1. ABC ANALYSIS
This is an analysis of a range of items that have different levels of significance and should be
handled or controlled differently. It is a form of Pareto Analysis in which items (such as activities,
customers, documents, inventory items, sales territories) are grouped into three categories (A, B
and C) in order of their estimated importance. “A” items important, “B” items are moderately
important and “C’ are marginally important.

•

Divides on-hand inventory into 3 classes
– A class, B class, C class
Basis is usually annual Peso volume
– Peso volume = Annual demand x Unit cost
Policies based on ABC analysis
– Develop class A suppliers more
– Give tighter physical control of A items
– Forecast A items more carefully

Classifying Items as ABC
•
•
•

Class A items are those which the annual dollar volume is high. Although such items
may represent only about 15% of the total inventory items, they represent 70% to 80% of
the total dollar usage.
Class B items are those inventory items of medium annual dollar volume. These items
may represent about 30% of inventory items and 15% to 25% of the total value.
Class C items are those with low annual dollar volume, which may represents only 5% of
the annual dollar volume but about 55% of the total inventory.

Example:
You’re an inventory control supervisor for CBA. Classify the following items as A, B, or C.

To better understand ABC Analysis see table below:

2. ECONOMIC ORDER QUANTITY (EOQ)
This is the ordering quantity which minimizes the balance of cost between inventory holding
costs and ordering costs. It is based on the following assumptions:
1. A known constant stock holding cost.
2. A known constant ordering cost.
3. The rate of demand is known (is deterministic).

A known constant price per unit.
Inventory replenishment is done instantaneously.
No stock-out is allowed.
Quantity discounts are not allowed – purchase price is constant.
Lead time is known and fixed.

EOQ answers the decision: How much of an item to order?
EOQ Model

The objective of inventory management is to minimize the total annual inventory cost. A
simplified graphical presentation in which cost of items, procurement cost and carrying cost
are depicted is shown in Figure 1.
It can be seen from the figure that large values of order quantity Q result in large carrying
cost. Similarly, when order quantity Q is large, fewer orders will be placed and procurement
cost will decrease accordingly. The total cost curve indicates that the minimum cost point
lies at the intersection of carrying cost and procurement cost curves.

Example
Sharp, Inc., a company that markets painless needles to hospitals, would like to reduce its
inventory cost by determining the optimal number of hypodermic needles to obtain per
order. The annual demand is 1000 units; the ordering cost is $10 per order; the carrying cost
per unit per year is $0.5; and the unit price of product is $10. The number of working days
per year is 250 days. In order to minimize the annual total cost, determine the following:
a. How many hypodermic needles should be ordered each time?
b. How many orders should be placed per year?
c. What is the expected time between orders?
d. How much is the optimal annual total inventory cost?
Solution:
a. Economic Order Quantity
Given:
D = 1,000 units
S = $10 per order
H = $0.50 per unit per year

Q* =

REORDER POINT (ROP)
While EOQ answers the “how much” question, the reorder point (ROP) tells “when to order”.
This is the minimum level of on-hand inventory that triggers a replenishment.
Lead time (L) is the time between placing and receiving an order.
To determine the ROP,
ROP = (demand per day) x (Lead time for a new order in days)
=dxL
where:
d = demand per year / number of working days in a year
Example:
An apple distributor has a demand for 8,000 iPods per year. The firm operates a 250-day
working year. On average, delivery of an order takes 3 working days. What is the reorder
points (ROP)?
Solution:
Given:
D = 8,000 iPods per year
250 working day per year
Lead time for orders = 3 working days

dxL
32 units per day x 3 days

SAFETY STOCK (SS)
Safety stock is used when demand is not constant or certain. It is defined as extra units of
inventory carried as protection against possible stockouts. Safety stock is used to achieve a
desired service level and avoid stock outs.
ROP = d x L + ss

Annual stockout costs = the sum of the units short x the probability x the stockout
cost/unit x the number of orders per year
Example:
ROP = 50 units
Orders per year = 6

Stockout cost = $40 per unit
Carrying cost = $5 per unit per year

What if the probability of having safety stock for 20 is 0%, for 10 is 10% and 0 is 20%.

4. QUANTITY DISCOUNT MODEL

•
•
•

Answers how much to order & when to order
Allows quantity discounts
– Reduced price when item is purchased in larger quantities
– Other EOQ assumptions apply
Trade-off is between lower price & increased holding cost

Quantity discounts are price reductions designed to induce large orders. If quantity
discounts are offered, the buyer must weigh the potential benefits of reduced purchase
price and fewer orders against the increase in carrying costs caused by higher average
inventories. Hence, the buyer's goal in this case is to select the order quantity that will
minimize total costs, where total costs the sum of carrying cost, ordering cost
and purchase cost.
Formula:

Total cost = Setup cost + Holding cost + Product cost

Example:

Wohl’s Discount Store tocks toy race car. Recently, the store has been given a quantity
discount schedule was shown in the next slide. Thus, the normal cost for the toy race
cars is ₱5.00. For the orders between 1,000 and 1,999 units, the unit cost drops to
₱4.80; for orders of 2,000 or more units, the unit cost is only ₱4.75. Furthermore,
ordering cost is ₱49.00 per order, annual demand is 5,000 race cars and inventory
carrying charge, as percent of cost, I, is 20%, or .20. What order quantity will minimize
the total inventory cost?

•
•

– Amount ordered varies
No continuous inventory count
– Possibility of stockout between intervals
Useful when vendors visit routinely
– Example: P&G rep. calls every 2 weeks

6. CYCLE COUNTING
Items are counted and records updated on a periodic basis. This is often used with ABC
analysis to determine cycle.

Advantages






Eliminates shutdowns and interruptions
Eliminates annual inventory adjustment
Trained personnel audit inventory accuracy
Allows causes of errors to be identified and corrected
Maintains accurate inventory records

Example:

5,000 items in inventory, 500 A items, 1,750 B items, 2,750 C items
Policy is to count A items every month (20 working days), B items every quarter (60
days), and C items every six months (120 days)
