PROCESS CHOICE
• Trade-off between flexibility and cost
• Flexible producers may be capable of
providing product bundles at prices
competing with low-cost producers
• Low-cost producers may be able to offer
enough customization to compete with
flexible producers

Designing
Service Operations

DO NOT DISTRIBUTE AND

Service Operations
CHARACTERISTICS:
✓ Service provided is often intangible - such as
ambiance, information, or peace of mind.
✓ Service is often created and delivered on the spot
with significant involvement of the customer.
✓ Hence, marketing and operations are interdependent.
✓ Consumption of a service is often nearly
simultaneous with its production.
✓ Barriers to entry are lower; so are barriers to exit service strategies are more “ hit-and-run”.

Some Definitions
• CUSTOMER CONTACT - the physical presence of
the customer in the service system.
• EXTENT OF CONTACT - the amount of time (or
percentage of time) the customer must be in the
system relative to the total time it takes to perform the
service.
• CREATION OF SERVICE - the work process
involved in providing the service itself.
The greater the percentage of contact time between the
customer and the service system, the greater the
degree of interaction between the two during the
production process.

SERVICE BLUEPRINTING
• Blueprint the service:
– service delivery process flowchart

• Identify customer contact points and
reduce contact where appropriate
• Improve the quality of contact
• Improve efficiency in low-contact
operations

Three Notions in a Service
Operation

1. SERVICE CONCEPT
- What a business provides the
customer
- Defines the fundamental nature of the
business
Answers the question:
What is it about the service the
customer values?

2. SERVICE LEVEL
Any measure applied to the process that
indicates its quality.
May be:

THE
CHALLENGE
OF
SERVICE
OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT IS TO
DEVISE A SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM
THAT
SUPPORTS
THE
SERVICE
CONCEPT
AND
MAINTAINS

Thinking Challenge
Consider McDonald’s
restaurants. Fact #1:
Franchisees of McDonald’s
have to go to ‘Hamburger U.’
They protest, ‘But, I’ve been in
the restaurant business 20
years – I know the restaurant
business!’ ‘Yes, but you don’t
know OUR business.’

Thinking Challenge
Fact #2: A typical McDonald’s
restaurant is run by unskilled
teenagers, whose mothers
can’t even get them to make
their beds in the morning.
What do these facts & your
own experiences suggest
about McDonald’s operations?

Answer
•

•

•

McDonald’s is not in the business of selling
haute cuisine, but ‘fuel’ – a standardized
product.
The new franchisee has to learn the McDonald’s
production system – a typical assembly line.
An assembly line requires low labor skills, but
high mechanization. Hence, unskilled teenagers
are used.
