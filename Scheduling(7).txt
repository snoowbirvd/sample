

the process of organizing, choosing and
timing resource usage to carry out all the
activities necessary to produce the desired
outputs at the desired times, while satisfying
a large number of time and relationship
constraints among the activities and the
resources (Morton and Pentico, 1993).
Schedule specifies the time each job starts
and completes on each machine, as well as
any additional resources needed.



pertains to establishing both the timing and
use of resources within an organization.
Under the operations function (both
manufacturing and services), scheduling
relates to use of equipment and facilities, the
scheduling of human activities, and receipt
of materials.









Routing: The operations to be performed, their
sequence, the work centers, & the time
standards
Bottleneck: A resource whose capacity is less
than the demand placed on it
Due date: When the job is supposed to be
finished
Slack: The time that a job can be delayed & still
finish by its due date
Queue: A waiting line

Forward Scheduling

Gantt charts (load & scheduling)
Assignment method











Named for Henry Gantt, a management pioneer
of the early 1900s. He proposed the use of a
visual aid for loading and scheduling.
Used to organize and clarify actual or intended
use of resources within a time framework.
Generally, time is represented horizontally with
scheduled resources listed vertically.
Managers are able to use the Gantt chart to
make trial-and-error schedules to get some
sense of the impact of different arrangements.

Shows relative workload in facility
Displays the loading and idle times for machines
or departments; this shows when certain jobs are
scheduled to start and finish and where idle time
can be expected.
Help the scheduler redo loading
assignments for better utilization of the
work centers.

Use to monitor job progress
On this type of Gantt chart, the vertical axis
shows the orders or jobs in progress while
the horizontal axis represents time.
A quick glance at the chart reveals which jobs
are on schedule and which jobs are on time.

Process job with shortest processing time first
Best rule for minimizing:
◦ Completion time (flow time)
◦ WIP inventory (average # jobs in system)
Disadvantage: Longer jobs get pushed back in
sequence
◦ Bad for customer relations

Process job with earliest due date first
Widely used by many companies
◦ If due dates important
◦ If MRP used

Scheduling

Used to sequence N jobs through 2 machines in
the same order
Johnson’s Rule – a technique for minimizing
makespan in a two-stage, unidirectional
process


Step 1 – List the jobs and the processing time for each
activity
Step 2 – Find the shortest activity processing time
among the jobs not yet scheduled
1. If the shortest Processing time is for a 1st activity, schedule
that job in the earliest available position in the job
sequence
2. If the shortest processing time is for 2nd activity, schedule
that job in the last available position in the job sequence
3. When you schedule a job eliminate it from further
consideration

Step 3 – Repeat step 2 until you have put all activities
for the job in the schedule
